## Results of my work in Git
I learned how to create repositories on GitHub, 
studied the version control mechanism.
I run Basic Git and shell commands from sh-file:
```
mkdir m1
cd m1
mkdir task1.1
cd task1.1
touch readme.txt
cd ../
cd ../
git add .
git status
git commit -m 'First commit'
git branch develop
git checkout develop
```
I edited index.html manually have resolved the merge conflict manually too.

 
## What DevOps is
DevOps is  a concept, a set of practices and rules that 
help fill the gap between  developers and employees responsible for 
maintaining and operating an application.
