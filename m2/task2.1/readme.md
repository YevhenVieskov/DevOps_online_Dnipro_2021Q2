# TASK 2.1
## PART 1. HYPERVISORS
1. What are the most popular hypervisors for infrastructure virtualization?
   The most popular hypervisors for infrastructure virtualization is a Citrix XenServer, 
   VMware ESX Server, VMWare Workstation, Microsort Hyper-V, Oracle Virtual Box
2. Briefly describe the main differences of the most popular hypervisors.
   The main difference between hypervisors is the type of architecture: 
   type 1 it runs as a control program directly on the hardware side of the computer; 
   type 2 it runs on the host operating system; 
   type 3 - the monolithic hypervisor includes hardware device drivers;
   type 4 - the microkernel, device drivers are located inside the host operating system
   
## PART 2. WORK WITH VIRTUALBOX
1. First run VirtualBox and Virtual Machine (VM).
1.1 Get acquainted with the structure of the user manual VirtualBox [1] (see list of
references in the end of the document)
1.2 From the official VirtualBox site [2] download the latest stable version of
VirtualBox according to the host operating system (OS) installed on the student's
workplace. For Windows, the file may be called, for example,
VirtualBox-6.1.10-138449-Win.exe. Install VirtualBox.     
1.2 Download the latest stable version of Ubuntu Desktop or Ubuntu Server from
the official site [3].
    ![alt vbox1.2](vbox1.2.jpg)
1.3 Create VM1 and install Ubuntu using the instructions [1, chapter 1.8]. Set machine
name as "host machine name"_"student last name"
      ![alt vbox1.3create](vbox1.3create.jpg)
1.4 Get acquainted with the possibilities of VM1 control - start, stop, reboot, save state,
use Host key and keyboard shortcuts, mouse capture, etc. [1, ch.1.9].
      ![alt vbox1.3installed](vbox1.3installed.jpg)
1.5 Clone an existing VM1 by creating a VM2 [1, ch.1.14].
     ![alt vbox1.5](vbox1.5.jpg)
1.6 Create a group of two VM: VM1, VM2 and learn the functions related to groups [1,
ch.1.10].
      ![alt vbox1.6](vbox1.6.jpg)
1.7 For VM1, changing its state, take several different snapshots, forming a branched
tree of snapshots [1, ch.1.11].
      ![alt vbox1.7](vbox1.7.jpg)
1.8 Export VM1. Save the *.ova file to disk. Import VM from *.ova file [1, ch.1.15].
      ![alt vbox1.8](vbox1.8.jpg)
2. Configuration of virtual machines
2.1 Explore VM configuration options (general settings, system settings, display,
storage, audio, network, etc.).
     ![alt vbox2.1](vbox2.1.jpg)
2.2 Configure the USB to connect the USB ports of the host machine to the VM
[1, ch.3.11].
      ![alt vbox2.2](vbox2.2.jpg)
2.3 Configure a shared folder to exchange data between the virtual machine and
the host [1, ch.4.3].
      ![alt vbox2.3](vbox2.3.jpg)
2.4 Configure different network modes for VM1, VM2. Check the connection
between VM1, VM2, Host, Internet for different network modes. You can use the ping
command to do this. Make a table of possible connections.

**Connection table**

Network type VM1    | localhost |internet |	VM2 NAT | VM2 netbridge | VM2 Etternet |	VM2 Host-only Ethernet 
--------------------|-----------|---------|---------|---------------|--------------|--------------------------
NAT	                |     T	    |    T	  |    F	|     F	        |       F	   |            F
netbridge	        |     T	    |    F	  |    F	|     F	        |       F	   |            F
Ethernet	        |     T	    |    F	  |    F	|     F	        |       F	   |            F
Host-only Ethernet	|     T	    |    F	  |    F	|     F	        |       F	   |            F


3. Work with CLI through VBoxManage.
3.1 Run the cmd.exe command line.
3.2 Examine the purpose and execute the basic commands of VBoxManage list,
showvminfo, createvm, startvm, modifyvm, clonevm, snapshot, controlvm [1, ch.8].

## PART 3. WORK WITH VAGRANT
1. Download the required version of Vagrant according to the instructions [5] and
according to the host operating system (OS) installed on the student's workplace. For
Windows, the file may be called, for example, vagrant_2.2.0_x86_64.msi. Install Vagrant.
Check the path to Vagrant bin in the Path variable (My computer -> Properties ->
Advanced system settings -> Advanced -> Environment Variables).
      ![alt vagrant1](vagrant1.jpg)
2. Run the powershell. Create a folder "student name" (in English). In this example,
create a folder vagrant_test. Next, go to the folder.
      ![alt vagrant2](vagrant2.jpg)
3. Initialize the environment with the default Vagrant box:
init hashicorp/precise64
      ![alt vagrant3](vagrant3.jpg)
4. Run vagrant up and watch for messages during VM boot and startup.
      ![alt vagrant4](vagrant4.jpg)
5. Connect to the VM using the program PuTTY (can be downloaded from [6]),
using SSH, IP address and port listed above (127.0.0.1:2222). By default, login - vagrant
and password are also vagrant
     ![alt vagrant4](vagrant5.jpg)
6. Record the date and time by executing the date command
      ![alt vagrant6](vagrant6.jpg)
7. Stop and delete the created VM.
      ![alt vagrant7](vagrant7.jpg)
8. Create your own Vagrant box [7]
      ![alt vagrant8](vagrant8.jpg)
9. (optional) Create a test environment from a few servers. Servers' parameters
      ![alt vagrant8](vagrant8.jpg)
are chosen independently by the student.
